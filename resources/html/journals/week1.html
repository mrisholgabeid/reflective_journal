                <p>The following is my reflective journal for Developing a Digital Identity. This is entry number one which covers the introduction of the module and what we will be learning overall.</p>

                <p>In the introdcuction we covered the main/key features in writing <span class="info-body">HTML</span> and <span class="info-body">CSS code</span>, such as the <span class="info-body">syntax</span>. We went through the syntax of both HTML and CSS so that we could be familiar in order to help us understand it better when it came to writing the code during the development of our own websites for the assignments. The main difference that we saw in the 2 languages is that HTML consists of <span class="info-body">elements</span>, whereas CSS consists of <span class="info-body">rules</span>.</p>
                
                <h3 class="sub-title">HTML</h3>
                
                <h4>A BRIEF HISTORY:</h4>
                
                <p>HTML was introduced in <strong>1989</strong> by <span class="info-body">Tim Berners-Lee</span> of <span class="info-body">CERN</span>. Since its introduction and throughout its time, it has seen many updates and changes from its very first version <span class="info-body">HTML 1.0</span> going to <span class="info-body">HTML 2</span>, <span class="info-body">HTML 3.2</span>, <span class="info-body">HTML 4</span>, <span class="info-body">XHTML 1</span>, <span class="info-body">XHTML 2</span>, <span class="info-body">HTML 5</span> and finally <span class="info-body">HTML 5.1</span>. All of the changes and updates took effect within <strong>7 years</strong> of the introduction of HTML... For more information please see <a href="https://www.w3.org/People/Raggett/book4/ch02.html" class="references">W3.org</a>.</p>
                
                <h4 class="sub-title-1">SYNTAX:</h4>
                
                <p>Despite the many changes and updates that HTML has gone through, its <span class="info-body">syntax</span> has always remained constant which made it easier for people to adopt to the new changes. When taking about <span class="info-body">HTML syntax</span> we are refering to how HTML is structured in order for the browser to be able to understand we as developers need it to output.</p>

                <p>HTML syntax is basically divided into <span class="info-body">2 main parts</span> that any web developer, whether <em>front-end</em> or <em>back-end</em> should be familiar with. The 2 main parts are:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Format/Structure</li>
                    <li>Tags</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h5>FORMAT:</h5>
                
                <p>The <span class="info-body">format</span> of writing HTML code is very basic and includes a few rules that are easy to understand. The rules are as follows:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li  class="list-explanations">Always start with an opening HTML tag <span class="info-body">&lt;html&gt;</span>, followed by an opening <span class="info-body">HEAD</span> tag which is, <span class="info-body">&lt;head&gt;</span>, then a title tag which is, <span class="info-body">&lt;title&gt;</span> in which you can writer the title of your webpage such as <strong>MY FIRST WEBPAGE</strong> followed by a closing title tag which is, <span class="info-body">&lt;/title&gt;</span> and a closing head tag which is, <span class="info-body">&lt;/head&gt;</span>. After that you introduce the opening body tag which is, <span class="info-body">&lt;body&gt;</span> followed by everything that will be included in the webpage when it is opened, for example: a <strong>heading 1 title</strong>; <span class="info-body">&lt;h1&gt;</span> <span class="info-code">WHY I CHOOSE HTML?</span> <span class="info-body">&lt;/h1&gt;</span>, a <strong>paragraph</strong>; <span class="info-body">&lt;p&gt;</span> <span class="info-code">I love HTML because it is the easiest, and most importantly, everyone should know it if they want to develop a website</span> <span class="info-body">&lt;/p&gt;</span>  and an <strong>image</strong>; <span class="info-body">&lt;img src="img/html.png"&gt;</span>, then followed by the closing body tag which is, <span class="info-body">&lt;/body&gt;</span> and finally the closing html tag which is, <span class="info-body">&lt;/html&gt;</span>. See <strong>example 1.1</strong> below... For more examples and explanations of HTML syntax please see  <a href="www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp" class="references">W3schools.com</a>.</li>                  
                
                <div class="example">
                    <h6 class="example-title">Example:</h6>
                    
                    <h6 class="example-code">&lt;img src="img/html.png"&gt;</h6>
                    
                    
                    <h6 class="example-title-desciption">Description:</h6>
                    
                    <h6 class="example-description">When the browser reads the <span class="info-body">&lt;img&gt;</span> tag above, it will understand that we need it to display an image on the webpage. The <span class="info-body">syntax</span> behind it is that, it will read the <strong>img</strong> tag and refer to the <span class="info-body">src</span> or source attribute, which will tell it the exact location of the image that we want to display. In this case, the image is located in an <span class="info-body">img</span> folder, and using the <span class="info-body">/</span>, it knows to go in that folder where it will find the image called <span class="info-body">html</span> with a file type <span class="info-body">.png</span>. With this code, the browser will know exactly where to go in order to find the image and display it on the webpage.</h6>
                </div>
                    
                    <li>Should always begin with an opening and closing tag of the same element.
                        
                        <ul>
                            <li>This means that for every tag that you open, must be closed. Except from a few exceptions such as the image tag <span class="info-body">&lt;img&gt;</span>, every other tag that is opened should have a corresponding closing tag. For example: The HTML tag:<span class="info-body">&lt;html&gt;</span> has a corresponding closing tag of <span class="info-body">&lt;/html&gt;</span></li>

                            <li>HTML tags follow a certain writing convention which differs depending on whether it is an <strong>opening tag</strong> or <strong>closing tag</strong>. As long as you are writing an HTML tag, it much consist of a <span class="info-body">&lt;</span> in the front of the tag, the name of the tag; such as <span class="info-body">html</span> and a <span class="info-body">&gt;</span> at the end of the tag. All together, a HTML tag reads <span class="info-body">&lt;html&gt;</span> which is known as an <strong>opening tag</strong>. The closing tag follows the same rules but it includes an extra element which is <span class="info-body">/</span> sign which is used just before writing the name of the tag itself, such as <span class="info-body">&lt;/html&gt;</span>. With the <strong>opening tag</strong> and <strong>closing tag</strong> in place, the browser will be able to differentiate where the <em>starting</em> and <em>ending points</em> of the website and/or elements are.</li>

                <h4>A BRIEF HISTORY:</h4>
                
                <p>CSS was introduced in <strong>November 4th, 1994</strong> by <span class="info-body">Hakon Wium</span> of <span class="info-body">CERN</span>. Similar HTML, CSS has experienced its fair share of updates and upgrades which made it more and more powerful after every update that it went through. There have been a 3 major versions of CSS which are <span class="info-body">CSS 1</span>, which was used by the <strong>W3C - World Wide Web Consortium</strong> who introduced the use of typography in the December, 1996, going to <span class="info-body">CSS 2</span> and finally the latest version which is <span class="info-body">CSS 3</span>. As newer versions of CSS were introduced, more and more features were established making <strong>CSS</strong> a powerful <em>tool</em> when styling content on a webpage. In order to learn more about the history of CSS and what things you can do with it as a website developer, please see <a href="https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS20/history.html" class="references">W3.org</a>.</p>
                
                <h4 class="sub-title-1">SYNTAX:</h4>
                
                <p>Even though CSS has gone through a few updates and upgrades throughout it's time, its <span class="info-body">syntax</span> has always remained constant no matter the version. When we are refering to <span class="info-body">CSS syntax</span> we are talking about how we can write <strong>CSS code</strong> so that our browsers can understand it and be able to differentiate it from other languages such as <strong>HTML</strong> or <strong>Java Script</strong>.</p>

                <p>CSS syntax consists of <span class="info-body">rules</span> which are  divided into <span class="info-body">2 main parts</span> that every web developer should be familiar with. These are:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Selector</li>
                    <li>Declaration</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h5>SELECTOR:</h5>
                
                <p>A <span class="info-body">selector</span> is simply an HTML element that we want to style on the webpage. A <strong>selector</strong> could be the <strong>body</strong>, an <strong>image</strong>, a <strong>video</strong>, a <strong>heading</strong>, an <strong>audio</strong> file and so no... or even <strong>html</strong> itself</p>
                
                <p>Unlike HTML, declaring rules in CSS is a little bit different. Instead of using <span class="info-body">tags</span> we simply write the name of the element that we want to style and then provide the declarations that will affect that element in the HTML which will be displayed in the webpage.</p>
                
                <div class="example">
                    <h6 class="example-title">Example:</h6>
                    
                    <h6 class="example-code">p {
                        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;color:red;
                        <br>}</h6>
                    
                    <h6 class="example-title-desciption">Description:</h6>
                    
                    <h6 class="example-description">The CSS line above is targeting the <span class="info-body">p or paragraph</span> tag in the HTML. This is a <strong>generalized</strong> tag because it is targeting all paragraph tags in the HTML which will be displayed on the webpage. The <span class="info-body">syntax</span> behind the code is that, the <strong>selector</strong>, in this case the <span class="info-body">paragraph</span> tag will be affected by the <strong>declarations specified</strong>. The declarations will be discussed further later. For an example, see the following example below:
                    
                    <h6 class="example-title-desciption">HTML CODE:</h6>
                    <span class="example-paragraph-indent">

                        <!--When the browser reads the <span class="info-body">&lt;img&gt;</span> tag above, it will understand that we need it to display an image on the webpage. The <span class="info-body">syntax</span> behind it is that, it will read the <strong>img</strong> tag and refer to the <span class="info-body">src</span> or source attribute, which will tell it the exact location of the image that we want to display. In this case, the image is located in an <span class="info-body">img</span> folder, and using the <span class="info-body">/</span>, it knows to go in that folder where it will find the image called <span class="info-body">html</span> with a file type <span class="info-body">.png</span>. With this code, the browser will know exactly where to go in order to find the image and display it on the webpage.--></h6>
